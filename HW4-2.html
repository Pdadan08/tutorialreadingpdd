		Besides learning the IELTS exam preparation tips and strategies, being aware of the common mistakes that other test takers while answering IELTS Reading sentence completion make can be helpful. So, we have listed the four most common mistakes below.
		<ul>
		<li> 
Exceeding the Word Limit: Using too many words to finish a sentence is a common error. Make sure you always count the words in your response and refer to the word limit specified in the instructions.</li>
		<li> Misreading the Passage: It's simple to mistake or overlook important facts in the rush to find the answers. So, before choosing an answer, candidates should ensure that they have understood the passage completely. </li>
		<li> Ignoring Synonyms: Occasionally, candidates get stuck trying to find word matches exactly in the question. Keep in mind that the chapter frequently uses synonyms or phrases that have the same meaning. </li>
